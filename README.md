# api-bff

// TODO add description here

Still in early development stages, but basically is a way to simplify the creation of a [BFF (Backend for frontend)](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/bff-backend-frontend-pattern-microservices-arpit-bhayani/) or a [Aggregator/Proxy](https://medium.com/nerd-for-tech/design-patterns-for-microservices-aggregator-pattern-99c122ac6b73).
API BFF uses file-system based routes to create the end-points, and [Zod](https://zod.dev/) for data validation.
